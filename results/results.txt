standardizing inputs yields 8800 mse after 1st epoch, 
but not doing it yields 3700 mse - prob bug in standardizing
64 batch size => 100 sec / epoch

fixed standardizer and it was still bad, upped lr to 0.005 and it's better

unet 101k train size: 
trainMse: 2323, valMse:2252

unet with 2xconv making images too green,
starts coloring faces properly after ~24 epochs
val loss stops decreasing after ~24 epochs
